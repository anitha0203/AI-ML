##  Intro to Machine Learning

[What is Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukzFI9rgwfU)

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.


**Artificial Intelligence**     -   Intelligent machines that think and act like human beings

**Machine Learning**            -   Systems learn things without being programmed to do so

**Deep Learning**               -   Machined think like human brains using artificial neural networks

### Types of Machine Learning

1. Supervised Learning
    - Systems are able to predict future outcomes based on past data.
    - Requires both an input and an output to be given to the model for it to be trained.

2. Unsupervised Larning
    - Systems are able to identify hidden patterns from the input data provided.
    - By making the data more readable and organized, the patterns, similarities or anomalies become more evident.

3. Reinforcement Learning
    - System are given no training.
    - It learns on he basis of the reward/ punishment it received for  performing its last action.
    - It helps increase the efficiency of a tool/ function or a program.


| Aspect             | Machine Learning                                              | Deep Learning                       |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Decision Making    | Machines make decisions based on past data.                  | Decisions through neural networks. |
| Training Data      | Requires relatively small training data.                    | Requires large training data.      |
| System Requirements| Works well on low-end systems.                              | Requires high-end systems.         |
| Feature Learning   | Features often need to be identified and manually coded.    | Features learned from data.        |
| Problem Solving    | Problem is divided into parts and solved individually.      | End-to-end problem solving.        |
| Testing Time       | Testing can take longer.                                    | Testing is often faster.           |
| Decision Explanation| Decision rationale can be explained using crisp rules.      | Reasoning may be difficult to interpret.|


### Machine Learning Algorithms

**Linear Regression**

Linear regression is perhaps one of the most well known and well understood algorithms in statistics and machine learning!

    Linear regression is a linear model,

    e.g. a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variable (x) and a single output variable (y)
        y = mx + c
        ........


**Decision Trees**

Decision Tree is a tree shaped algorithm used to determine a course of action 

Each branch of the tree represents a possible decision, occurrence or reaction

**Support Vector Machine**

Support Vector Machine is a widely usd classification algorithms!

The idea of Support Vector Machine is simple: The algorithm creates a separation line which divides the classes in the best possible manner.

For example, dog or cat, disease or no disease
