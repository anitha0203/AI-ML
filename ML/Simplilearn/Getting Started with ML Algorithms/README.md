##  Machine Learning Algorithms

### Supervised Learning Algorithms

1. Regression 
    -   Simple Linear Regression
    -   Multiple Linear Regression
    -   Polynomial Linear Regression
    
    **Linear Regression**

    Linear Regression is a statistical model used to predict the relationship between independent and dependent variables.

    It is a statistical method that helps find the relationship between an independent and dependent variable, both of which are continuous.


2. Classification

    **Logistic Regression**

    It is a classification algorithm, used to predict binary outcomes for a given set of independent variables. The dependent variable's outcome is discrete.


### Decision Tree
Decision Tree is a tree shaped diagram used to determine a course of action. Each branch of the tree represents a possible decision a possible decision, occurrence or reaction

**Entropy**     -   Entropy is the measure of randomness or unpredictability in the dataset

**Information gain**    -   It is the measure of decrease in entropy after the dataset is split

**Leaf Node**   -   Leaf node carries the classification or the decision

**Decision Node**  -   Decisin node has two or more branches

**Root Node**       -   The top most Decision node is known as the Root node
 
### Random Forest
Random forest or Random Decision Forest is a method that operates by constructing multiple Decision Trees during training phase.

The Decision of the majority of the trees is choosen by the random forest as the final decision
